# Layouts
All of the html page layouts are here, they are the framework that the content/css/javascript is inserted into

# Folders

**/page** Used by hugo to create each subpage dynamically.

**/partials** All of the sub-sections that index.html and subpages points to. Each page should have its own subfolder for partials.

**index.html** The root file for the site and is just the URL. Links to other subpages.

**404.html** The page delivered when a page is not found anywhere on the site.

*TODO:* make sure hugo uses 404.html always
